## Research

### [🗨️ Sentiment Analysis of ChatGPT for Therapy](https://www.scu.edu/cas/mathcs/news-and-events/stories/dr-smita-ghosh-awarded-a-whitham-collaborative-grant.html)
- Proposed and developed a graph model to represent post-to-comment relation for improved social media analysis
- Cleaned web scraped data for sentiment analysis, stance classification, and analysis from Psychology department

### 🔒 Password Security with ML (Submitted for Publicaion)
- Designed evaluation metric based on NLP metrics (WER and ROUGE) to evaluate models on 100,000+ results
- Generated and presented two supplementary charts of common prediction errors to primary investigators for feedback to refine project objectives through enhancing model evaluation metric
- Employed Python scripts to preprocess and clean 200,000+ lines of data to improve model performance

### 🌐 Graph Neural Networks for Popularity Prediction (in Progress)
- Delivered literature reviews and two presentations on current GNN research papers to enhance understanding and evaluate applicability to research question
- Integrated two research papers into model inorder to leverage strength of both


### Projects

### [⚾ SMT Data Challenge](https://github.com/tsaichenlin/smt)
- Designed and executed multimodal NN in Tensorflow and Keras to holistically assess player fielding
- Leveraged embeddings, bidirectional GRU, and attention to integrate and analyze data from four distinct sources
- Enhanced custom attention performance by 3 times by implementing Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

### [🌐 WebCrack](https://github.com/tsaichenlin/WebCrackExtension)
- Lead backend development for finalist project in Hack For Humanity Hackathon out of 248 participants
- Implemented LangChain and ChatGPT with prompt engineering to assess news articles for bias in a Chrome extension
- Utilized regex and web scraping to find 5 supplementary articles to cross-reference articles to increase accuracy of bias analysis
